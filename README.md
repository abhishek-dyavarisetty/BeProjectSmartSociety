Introduction
Security has becoming an important issue everywhere. Home security is becoming
necessary nowadays as the possibilities of intrusion are increasing day by day. Safety
from theft are the most important requirements of home security system for people. A
traditional home security system gives the signals in terms of alarm. However, the GSM
(Global System for Mobile communications) based security systems provides enhanced
security as whenever a signal from sensor occurs, a text message is sent to a desired
number to take necessary actions.

Nowadays, the security level is very important, always emphasized and enhanced sys-
tem. Different ways of security system have been enhanced such as use a large number
of security officers, the use of sophisticated weapons, the use of alarms, monitoring sys-
tem, through the production of electronic hardware and software and much more. All of
this improvement depends on their usage. One of the most important safety system and
required for all social group is home security. Houses need to be monitored at all times

such as from theft. Recently, the rate of crimes involving robbery, murder and fires is
increasing and worrying all of us. So, home surveillance system must be upgraded to
be more effective to keep up with the increasing crime rate
Home security has changed a lot from the last century and will be changing in coming
years [1]. Security is an important aspect or feature in the smart home applications [2].
The new and emerging concept of smart homes offers a comfortable, convenient, and
safe environment for occupants. Conventional security systems keep homeowners, and
their property, safe from intruders by giving the indication in terms of alarm. However,
a smart home security system offers many more benefits.
The first security system uses a web camera, installed in house premises, which is
operated by software installed on the PC and it uses Internet for communication. The
camera detects motion of any intruder in front of the camera dimensions or camera
range. The software communicates to the intended user via Internet network and at the
same time it gives sound alert. The second security system is SMS based and uses GSM
technology to send the SMS to the owner. The proposed system is aimed at the security
of Home against Intruders and Fire.
Rapid development in the technology has increased the risk of intrusion and threat.
Using smart security cameras on daily basis allows a person to monitor his property and
locality. The majority of organization and administrations are making use of such secu-
rity cameras with the intention to save their business as well as property from terrorists
and illegal entry. Nowadays, the security cameras have become much more advanced,

reasonable, smaller and straight forward.

In our busy life we don’t have much time to monitor and to keep a watch on ev-
erything. From every family most of the members are working, or even in malls and
hospital to monitor each and every space is not possible. It is 21st century and we need
to think smartly to make our life better, easier and secure, so instead of sitting at once
place for longer why not monitor the security in real time basis. Just by click on the
YES or NO option you can decide who can enter your premises Isn’t it great!!

1.1 Need of Project

In Previous system there were many problems such as such as high cost, low intelligence,
poor stability, weak security. Therefore, to solve these problems we are using Raspberry pi 2
which can be combined with the Linux operating system, generating voice through raspberry
pi 2 would be easy with the help of microphone This project has advantages such as higher
intelligence, higher stability, and easy installation and disadvantage as it requires high cost and
continues mobile data network is required to send message via android app, if the network is
not available this project may not work properly.

Why Use Smart Society Security Systems?

Smart home technology is all the rage, and smart security systems are one of the best ways to
dip your toes into the smart home waters. How can a smart security system totally change the
way that you protect your property and your family? b

1.1.1 Smart Security Systems Are Useful

Traditional security systems are designed to protect your property by setting off an alarm in
the event of an intrusion or other emergency events. While traditional security systems are
effective, smart security systems are useful all of the time. Want to know when your kids came
home from school? Check your smart security system. Want to see who just visited your colony
and let them know to leave the package on the back porch? Use your smart security system!

Smart Security Systems Are Easy to Use

Smart security systems are designed with the user in mind, unlike traditional security systems.
They feature apps that can be downloaded directly to your phone or your tablet to keep you

Introduction

connected to your home as often as you had like to be. Instead of dashing to the control panel
to disarm your alarm when you get home, it is as easy as tapping a button on your phone when
you are driving home. Smart home security systems can also integrate with other smart home
features like temperature control.

Smart Security Systems Are Proactive

Traditional security systems are reactive, as they work in response to an event that has already
occurred, like a door or window opening. Smart security systems are designed to follow your
typical living patterns and be proactive. Smart security systems can let you know that your
toddler left their room at 2:00 AM for a late-night snack break or remind you that you never
closed the garage door when you came home before bed.

1.2 Existing System

Your home is your kingdom, and it’s the only biggest investments you have ever made. Keeping
it safe and secure is a top priority of every houseowners. Advancing in smart home technology
and home automation security products, you can now keep an eye on your home’s cameras,
security solutions and more, no matter where you reside in the world.

Existing security are pretty much cable of providing security but there is always a room for
improvement, existing system basically compromises of

1.2.1 Fingerprint System:

The fingerprint biometric system are easy to capture the data, so are very popular. These are
used to secure entry devices for building door locks and computer network access. These are
used in banks for authorization at ATMs, credit cards. More recent application includes use of
fingerprints for administering drugs and controlled substances to patients.

Chapter 1, Section 1.

Key Features are:

Relatively small storage space is required for the biometric template it reduces the size of
the databases required
One of the most developed biometrics, with more history, research and design.
Each and every finger print including all the fingers are different, even identical twins
have unique fingerprints.
It has the potential for forensic use as most of the countries have existing fingerprint
databases.
Comparatively inexpensive and provides very high levels of accuracy.
1.2.2 Hand Geometry:

Hand Geometry Biometric Recognition System uses the geometric shape of the hand to identify
whether the person is legitimate or not. This system also uses finger length, thickness, and
curvature in order to verify. The hand geometry is not distinctive but it is the optimal choice.
The hand geometry data collection is simpler and hand geometry can be combined with other
biometrics like finger print and iris scanner
Key Features are:

Very small template size, and it is easy to maintain and store large database
High reliable and accurate
It is Robust, user friendly and easy to integrate into existing and third-party systems
Ideal for rough outdoor environments like construction industry and can handle high
throughput of people
Comparatively inexpensive offers excellent return on investment
Introduction

1.2.3 IRIS Scanner:

The iris capture consists of the coloured tissue surrounding the pupil .The iris recognition sys-
tems are known as real time, high confidence recognition of person identification. These sys-
tems are used in many applications like passports, activation security, and controlling access to
restricted areas at airports, database access and computer login, access to building and homes,
border crossings and other government programme

Key Features are:

Identification with no limitation on numbers.
The most robust biometric technology available in the market today never had a false
acceptance.
Biometric templates once captured do not need to be enrolled again, iris stable throughout
a human life.
1.2.4 Voice Recognition System:

Alternatively referred to as speech recognition, voice recognition is a computer software pro-
gram or hardware device with the ability to decode the human voice. Voice recognition is
commonly used to operate a device, perform commands, or write without having to use a key-
board, mouse, or press any buttons. Today, this is done on a computer with automatic speech
recognition (ASR) software programs. Many ASR programs require the user to "train" the ASR
program to recognize their voice so that it can more accurately convert the speech to text. The
voice recognition biometric systems are used for access control, banking, government offices
and entertainment applications, smart cards, PIN and other security purposes.
Key Features are:

Easily installs into current deadbolt hole within few minutes
Chapter 1, Section 1.

Compatible with both Android, iOS and other major devices
••Steady and classy design blends with any home décor style
1.3 Proposed System

The System we aimed to design basically is an integration of Major Web services

AWS Facial Rekognition
AWS Alexa
AWS S
Android application to wrap up the system
This project utilizes a camera, a Raspberry Pi, Amazon Alexa, and AWS Facial Rekogni-
tion in order to allow a user to ask Alexa about who exactly is ... From there we worked
on integrating the Raspberry Pi and the camera with this project to be able to communi-
cate with Amazon Web Services
The interaction of the app is as follows:
1. Someone visits on your door and you hear their knock.
2. You ask "Alexa, Recognize me ?".
3. Alexa takes a picture of the person at your door and analyzes their face by comparing
the stored template in the S3 storage.
4. If their face exists in the repository of faces you have approved, Alexa will tell you
that person is at your door.
Introduction

1.4 Objectives

Our objective is to build an easy to install and low cost smart security system with the function
of facial recognition using image processing and voice assistance through raspberry pi 2. We
aim to maximize security and optimize convenience in order to provide a safe and comfortable
home security.

To achieve the main objective, several sub-objectives have been identified and they are as
follows:

If a person is already a resident of a society he will directly be authenticated and will be
given access to enter in the society.
If a non-residing person visits the society then his face won’t be recognized and then
voice assistant will ask where he/she wants to visit after that a prompt notification will
be generated and passed to the asked authenticate person. If the person gives the ac-
cess then he/she will be authenticated. If the Intruder forcefully enter the society then a
alarm/notification will be generated to all the authenticated people to be alert.
if a person or intruder purposely try’s to enter into the society the system it self will gener-
ate burglar alarm, along with the image of the person will be send as the push notification
via android application so that the resident get alert.
1.5 Scope

In this system large amount of security is provided to the bank system all problems related with
video can overcome. Such checks must allow the data owner to efficiently, frequently, quickly
and securely verify that the security system and get the live operation on his phone. 4) In case
none of the above communication means are possible, user can simply use email to send au-
thenticated mails to home server account and control the system. 5) Proper authentication using

Chapter 1, Section 1.

mobile number, email id, and passwords is done before the user is allowed to control/monitor
the home server. 6) Using a camera and motion detection algorithm user is also informed about
any intrusion and the image/video Is transmitted online. 7) User can also send message by
clicking in the YES or NO button to block the visitor. 8) Voice assistant in our project plays
a very important role as the security breech can be avoided at that moment of time.9) Burglar
alarm gets generated if the person who is visiting doesn’t follows the instruction this helps the
residers in taking the needful action This concept of smart society can also be implemented for
business spaces

1.6 Application

Availability of this project is basically that there was a time when the surveillance techniques
were utilized only in shopping centres and malls. Now-a-days, you can notice closed-circuit
televisions almost at any place you visit, from a small store to homes and holy places. As a
result, they guarantee greater publicized security at a minimum fraction of the cost.

Monitoring on the basis of real time, traditionally big organizations have always had the
benefits of video surveillance manned by security professionals. In the past times, the capturing
and transmission used to take considerable amount time. But, modern technologies let users to
check status and reply according to alarms immediately, and the use of firebase database is like
a cherry on the cake for this project storing data in real time and displaying it to the user at that
moment is the key feature that needs to be taken care for that purpose firebase database is used

1.7 Organization of the report

The rest of the report is organised as follows, in Chapter 2, Literature Survey is discussed. The
proposed system is discussed in Chapter 3. In Chapter 4 experimental results are shown and
discussed. Final conclusion of chapter is discussed in Chapter 5.

tection and Tracking using KLT Algorithm" Institution of Ap-
plied Science and Intelligent System. National Research Coun-
cil of Italy.
Object detection and tracking are important in many computer vision ap-

plications including activity recognition, automotive safety, and surveil-

lance. In this example, you will develop a simple face tracking system by

dividing the tracking problem into three parts:

Chapter 2, Section 2.

Detect a face
First, you must detect the face. Use the vision.Cascade Object De-
tector System objectTM to detect the location of a face in a video
frame. The cascade object detector uses the Viola-Jones detection
algorithm and a trained classification model for detection. By de-
fault, the detector is configured to detect faces, but it can be used to
detect other types of objects.
Identify facial features to track
The KLT algorithm tracks a set of feature points across the video
frames. Once the detection locates the face, the next step in the
example identifies feature points that can be reliably tracked. This
example uses the standard, "good features to track" proposed by Shi
and Tomasi.
Track the face
With the feature points identified, you can now use the vision.Point
Tracker System object to track them. For each point in the previous
frame, the point tracker attempts to find the corresponding point in
the current frame. Then the estimate Geometric Transform function
is used to estimates the translation, rotation, and scale between the
old points and the new points. This transformation is applied to the
bounding box around the face.

The automatic recognition of human faces presents a significant
challenge to the pattern minor differences from person to person.
They are actually within one class of "human face". Furthermore,
lighting conditions change, while facial expressions and pose varia-
tions further complicate the face recognition task as one of the diffi-
cult problems in pattern analysis. This paper proposes a novel con-
cept: namely, that faces can be recognized using a line edge map
(LEM). The LEM, a compact face feature, is generated for face
coding and recognition. A thorough investigation of the proposed
concept is conducted which covers all aspects of human face recog-
nition, i.e. face recognition under.

(b) varying lighting conditions.
(c) varying facial expressions.
(d) varying pose.
The system performances are also compared with the eigenface method,

one of the best face recognition techniques, and reported experi-
mental results of other methods. A face prefiltering technique is
proposed to speed up the searching process. It is a very encouraging
finding that the proposed face recognition technique has performed
superior to the eigenface method in most of the comparison experi-
ments. This research demonstrates that LEM together with the pro-
posed generic line segment Hausdorff distance measure provide a
new way for face coding and recognition.

3.3.1 Alexa Echo Device:

Using Alexa is as simple as asking a question. Just ask to play music, read

the news, control your smart home, tell a joke, and more—Alexa will respond

instantly. Whether you are at home or on the go, Alexa is designed to make

your life easier by letting you voice-control your world. Explore more things

to try with Alexa. Alexa lives in the cloud so it’s always getting smarter, and

updates are delivered automatically. The more you talk to Alexa, the more it

Present Report on Investigation

adapts to your speech patterns, vocabulary, and personal preferences. Alexa

comes included with Echo and other Alexa devices.

3.3.2 Raspberry Pi:

A Raspberry Pi is a credit card-sized computer originally designed for educa-

tion, inspired by the 1981 BBC Micro. Creator Eben Upton’s goal was to create

a low-cost device that would improve programming skills and hardware under-

standing at the pre-university level. But thanks to its small size and accessible

price, it was quickly adopted by tinkerers, makers, and electronics enthusiasts

for projects that require more than a basic microcontroller (such as Arduino

devices).

3.3.3 Webcam:

A webcam – short for ‘web camera’ – is a digital camera that’s connected to a

computer. It can send live pictures from wherever it’s sited to another location

by means of the internet. Many desktop computer screens and laptops come

with a built-in camera and microphone, but if yours doesn’t, you can add a

separate webcam at any time

3.3.4 Android Phone:

Android is basically the mobile base open source operating system developed by

Google.INC. Pick an Android mobile phone and you can choose from hundreds

Chapter 3, Section 3.3

of great applications and multitask with ease. You’ll also get regular software

updates that add great new features to your smartphone.

3.3.5 Breadboard:

A Breadboard is basically a tool which is use to interconnection within the

circuits. A breadboard is a widely used tool to design and test circuit. You

do not need to solder wires and components to make a circuit while using a

bread board. It is easier to mount components reuse them. Since, components

are not soldered you can change your circuit design at any point without any

hassle. It consist of an array of conductive metal clips encased in a box made of

white ABS plastic, where each clip is insulated with another clips. There are a

number of holes on the plastic box, arranged in a particular fashion. A typical

bread board layout consists of two types of region also called strips. Bus strips

and socket strips. Bus strips are usually used to provide power supply to the

circuit. It consists of two columns, one for power voltage and other for ground.

Socket strips are used to hold most of the components in a circuit. Generally

it consists of two sections each with 5 rows and 64 columns. Every column is

electrically connected from inside

3.3.6 LED:
LED is the hardware component which emits light when given a small amount

of current. In the simplest terms, a light-emitting diode (LED) is a semicon-

ductor device that emits light when an electric current is passed through it.

Present Report on Investigation

Light is produced when the particles that carry the current (known as electrons

and holes) combine together within the semiconductor material. Since light

is generated within the solid semiconductor material, LEDs are described as

solid-state devices. The term solid-state lighting, which also encompasses or-

ganic LEDs (OLEDs), distinguishes this lighting technology from other sources

that use heated filaments (incandescent and tungsten halogen lamps) or gas dis-

charge (fluorescent lamps).

3.4 UML Diagram

To model a system, the most important aspect is to capture the dynamic be-

havior. Dynamic behavior means the behavior of the system when it is run-

ning/operating.Only static behavior is not sufficient to model a system rather

dynamic behavior is more important than static behavior. In UML, there are

five diagrams available to model the dynamic nature.

3.4.1 Sequence Diagram

To understand what a sequence diagram is, it’s important to know the role of the

Unified Modeling Language, better known as UML. UML is a modeling toolkit

that guides the creation and notation of many types of diagrams, including be-

havior diagrams, interaction diagrams, and structure diagrams.

A sequence diagram is a type of interaction diagram because it describes how—and

in what order—a group of objects works together. These diagrams are used by

software developers and business professionals to understand requirements for

a new system or to document an existing process. Sequence diagrams are some-

times known as event diagrams or event scenarios.

3.5 Algorithm Implementation

3.5.1 Alexa Voice Service

The Alexa Voice Service (AVS) enables you to access cloud-based Alexa
capabilities with the support of AVS APIs, hardware kits, software tools,
and documentation. We simplify building voice-forward products by
handling complex speech recognition and natural language understand-
ing in the cloud, reducing your development costs and accelerating your
time to market. Best of all, regular Alexa updates bring new features
to your product and add support for a growing assortment of compatible
smart home devices. Build with AVS

3.5.2 AWS Lambda

AWS Lambda is a compute service that lets you run code without pro-
visioning or managing servers. AWS Lambda executes your code only
when needed and scales automatically, from a few requests per day to
thousands per second. You pay only for the compute time you consume

there is no charge when your code is not running. With AWS Lambda,
you can run code for virtually any type of application or back-end service
all with zero administration. AWS Lambda runs your code on a high-
availability compute infrastructure and performs all of the administration
of the compute resources, including server and operating system mainte-
nance, capacity provisioning and automatic scaling, code monitoring and
logging. All you need to do is supply your code in one of the languages
Chapter 3, Section 3.5

that AWS Lambda supports (currently Node.js, Java, C, Go and Python).
You can use AWS Lambda to run your code in response to events, such
as changes to data in an Amazon S3 bucket or an Amazon DynamoDB
table; to run your code in response to HTTP requests using Amazon API
Gateway; or invoke your code using API calls made using AWS SDKs.
With these capabilities, you can use Lambda to easily build data process-
ing triggers for AWS services like Amazon S3 and Amazon DynamoDB
process streaming data stored in Kinesis, or create your own back end
that operates at AWS scale, performance, and security.
3.5.3 AWS S3
Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is storage for the Internet.
You can use Amazon S3 to store and retrieve any amount of data at any
time, from anywhere on the web. You can accomplish these tasks us-
ing the AWS Management Console, which is a simple and intuitive web
interface. This guide introduces you to Amazon S3 and how to use the
AWS Management Console to complete the tasks shown in the following
figure.
3.5.4 AWS Rekognition
Amazon Rekognition makes it easy to add image and video analysis to
your applications. You just provide an image or video to the Rekognition
API, and the service can identify objects, people, text, scenes, and activi-
ties. It can detect any inappropriate content as well. Amazon Rekognition
Present Report on Investigation

also provides highly accurate facial analysis and facial recognition. You
can detect, analyze, and compare faces for a wide variety of use cases, in-
cluding user verification, cataloging, people counting, and public safety

3.5.5 Flask

Flask is part of the categories of the micro framework. Micro frame-
work are normally framework with little to no dependencies to external
libraries. This has pros and cons. Pros would be that the framework is
light, there are little dependency to update and watch for security bugs,
cons is that some time you will have to do more work by yourself or
increase yourself the list of dependencies by adding plugins

Results and Discussions
4.1 Testing
4.1.1) Black Box Testing:

Black box testing treats the software as a "black box"without any knowl-
edge of internal implementation. Black box testing methods include:
equivalence partitioning, boundary value analysis, all-pairs testing, fuzz
testing, model-based testing, traceability matrix, exploratory testing and
specification-based testing.

4.1.2) White box testing:

White box testing is when the tester has access to the internal data struc-
tures and algorithms including the code that implement these.

Chapter 4, Section 4.1

4.1.3) Integration testing:

It is any type of software testing, which seeks to verify the interfaces between
components against a software design. Software components may be integrated
in an iterative way or all together ("big bang"). Normally the former is con-
sidered a better practice since it allows interface issues to be localized more
quickly and fixed.

4.1.4) Acceptance testing can mean one of two things:

A smoke test is used as an acceptance test prior to introducing a new build to the
main testing process, i.e. before integration or regression. Acceptance testing
performed by the customer, often in their lab environment on their own HW, is
known as user acceptance testing (UAT).

4.3 Summary

This project deals with developing application in order to provide smart video
security system for the banks. This is achieved by using image processing using
AWS Facial Rekognition. We deal with the problem of implementing security
system by using the simple concept of CCTV and by performing operation on
that we develop the operational system. This problem tries to obtain and verify
a proof that the data that is stored by a user at a remote data storage in database.
A wide variety of systems require reliable personal recognition schemes to ei-
ther confirm or determine the identity of an individual requesting their services.
The purpose of such schemes is to ensure that the rendered services are accessed
only by a legitimate user, and not anyone else. Examples of such applications
include secure access to buildings, computer systems, laptops, cellular phones
and ATMs. In the absence of robust personal recognition schemes, these sys-
tems are vulnerable to the wiles of an impostor.Our system, refers to the auto-
matic recognition of individuals based on their physiological and/or behavioral
characteristics. By using biometrics it is possible to confirm or establish an in-
dividual’s identity based on “who she is”, rather than by “what she possesses”
(e.g., an ID card) or “what she remembers” (e.g., a password). In this paper,
we give a brief overview of the field of biometrics and summarize some of its
advantages, disadvantages, strengths, limitations, and related privacy concerns

can make everything wireless in this project and also better video quality
which will be easy to operate and in a way the security information can
be carried and viewed anywhere.
Our focus on high end reliable access control solutions continues with the
introduction of our Smart society based of facial recognition and voice as-
sistant. It provides employees with lightning-speed access to your offices
and restricted areas with face recognition technology.
Face Detection increases security while voice commands help maintain-
ing high throughput for access into buildings, making the process effort-

less for the civilians. The push notification system helps the civilians to
know regarding the visiting person well in advance.
The concept of face detection is to collect facial biometric data from a
person in front. The captured information is matched against the tem-
plates stored in the biometric database. It can be connected to a LAN
and remotely managed through the Administration software. With an ac-
cess controller, face recognition system can be effectively used with other
Biometric (IRIS, Finger based) and card based system.

Future Scope:

Use Biometric verification as a security mechanism is gaining a lot of
popularity among the public security systems as well as in the commer-
cial market. In our day to daylife, we witness the use of biometric in
so many places such as the digital attendance system at offices, security
checkpoints at airports, wearable tech gadgets retrieving our biological
information, and even our national ID cards aka Aadhaar cards are cre-
ated using biometrics technology. In fact, this national ID program holds
the largest biometric database in the world.

Your face as currency:
In July, a Finnish company called Uniqul released a video of a
project in the works, a pay-by-face authentication system. The idea?
At a store, rather than paying with cash or a credit card, you give a
“meaningful nod” to a scanner to make a purchase. A Huffington
Post article describes this new tech, and also gives a peak at the Mil-
lennial ATM, which uses facial recognition as its primary security
method.
Shattered Glass:
The fact that someone’s face can be used to find out private infor-

mation is especially disconcerting given Google Glass’ emergence
on the scene. In June, US lawmakers questioned Google about the
privacy implications of the device and, in response, Google stressed
that they “won’t be approving any facial recognition Glassware at
this time.” But of course, it’s not completely up to them. In July,
Stephen Balaban announced to NPR and the world that he had hacked
Glass in order to give it facial recognition powers. “ g
